# Notes

## Next steps (jQuery app)
[] append new scrap to DOM
  [] refactor getScraps(id)
    [] $('#show-scraps').on('click') needs to hide/show div, not populate it with content
[x] show new scrap without having to click anything

## Bugs

- ~~Omniauth doesn't take you to Google sign in page, automatically signs you in with primary Google account~~ resolved on own
- Can add pre-existing scrap using 'create new scrap' feature (11/3)

## Next steps (from Rails-only app)

* priority input for bowl_scraps is being created without a scrap, which doesn't make sense
* fix this somehow, maybe by changing the models to be Bowl, Activity, Scrap?

scrap belongs_to bowl
bowl has_many scraps

scrap belongs_to activity
activity has_many scraps

bowl has_many activities, through: :scraps

scrap.priority

???

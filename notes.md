# Notes

## Next steps

* priority input for bowl_scraps is being created without a scrap, which doesn't make sense
* fix this somehow, maybe by changing the models to be Bowl, Activity, Scrap?

scrap belongs_to bowl
bowl has_many scraps

scrap belongs_to activity
activity has_many scraps

bowl has_many activities, through: :scraps

scrap.priority

???

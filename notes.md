# Notes

## Next steps (jQuery app)
[x] add dynamic form for scraps on bowl show page
  [x] hijack update bowl button to do not trigger update in controller
  [x] create scrap not rendering ajax on page, but exists in console
[] refactor javascript

## Bugs

- ~~Omniauth doesn't take you to Google sign in page, automatically signs you in with primary Google account~~ resolved on own
- Can add pre-existing scrap using 'create new scrap' feature (11/3)

## Next steps (from Rails-only app)

* priority input for bowl_scraps is being created without a scrap, which doesn't make sense
* fix this somehow, maybe by changing the models to be Bowl, Activity, Scrap?

scrap belongs_to bowl
bowl has_many scraps

scrap belongs_to activity
activity has_many scraps

bowl has_many activities, through: :scraps

scrap.priority

???
